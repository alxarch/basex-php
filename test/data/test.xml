			<para><phrase>And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler… who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. I wouldn't feel so bad… if Bender just understood the pain he caused me. Give it to me straight, doc. Don't sugarcoat it. Your entire family died When a plane piloted by your fiancée… crashed into your uninsured home. And you have inoperable cancer. Bet you didn't expect that one! Does he not understand humanoid emotion? I just wish Bender could feel Through the miracle of science, that can be done.</phrase></para>

			<para><phrase>Squirm all you want, you nasty dumpling. One less species for the universe, one more breakfast for. Zoidberg? Me saving things the leech. Not the eating of it. Zoidberg, I'm very surprised I know. I miss you so much, Leela, even more than when you were here. I miss you, too, Fry. And you probably think what I'm doing is wrong. But it's something I really care about. You don't have to explain, Leela. You're you. That's all I need to know. I'll miss her, too, buddy. Dibs on her iPod.</phrase></para>

			<para><phrase>Thank you. There, good as new. Except your dorsal fin. I couldn't find it after the crash. You call that living? Why wouldn't you let me graft a laser cannon on your chest? To crush those who disobey you. I guess we're two different people. Thanks for the ride, Amy. No hard feelings about your date, or stuff. I had fun. If I ever feel lonely… I'll look at this disfiguring scar and think of you. Anyway, it's nice to have my own body back. How's the corpse? Hooked up okay? Seems to be.</phrase></para>
