<p>Then I'm going in after him! He'd come after me! Acting like a moron won't bring your dog back. Then all hope is lost! Goodbye, Seymour. Please stop crying, Fry. Here. I assumed you were just pretending to toy with my emotions. What have I done? You didn't do anything. Don't beat yourself up. Fry, I'm sorry. I should have understood how someone can love an inferior creature. Not in the way of the ancient Greeks, but the way a robot loves a humanâ€¦ a human loves a dog, and occasionally, a gorilla loves a kitty.</p>
<p>You took his name? Oh, God, no! In several ways! Assuming the 15th pile of children buys us a few seconds, we will then execute maneuver 45. Followed by maneuver 44. Forty-six. Oh, great. Now I have to start back at the beginning with maneuver two. One. AdmiraI, wiII we stop attacking at any point or is this one of those phony-baloney feel-good wars Iike the war on drugs? What's your name, smart mouth? Lars FiIImore. on-again, off-again paramour. Perhaps a suicide mission would knock the insubordination out of you.</p>
<p>Bender, no! You can't beat the best players in the universe. You're not lucky enough. Oh, no? I'm 40 % lucky. The scrap metal I'm made from included a truckload of horseshoes from the luckiest racehorses in Mexico, who had just been sent to a glue factory. They don't sound so lucky to me. Not without their shoes. That's great! Here, Bendy, take this. It will give you 70 % more luck. It's the Donbot's lucky robot's foot. All right! With two kinds of luck, I can't lose. No, wait, three.</p>
